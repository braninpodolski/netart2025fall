    <h1>Algorithmic Constellations of a Bygone Era</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Branin Podolski</h2>
    <p>The intersection between user and software - now taken for granted but once a true revolution. These sites explore both the beauty that can emerge from algorithms and randomness, while also giving the human domain over these algorithms, exercising control to manipulate data in ways that can yield truly stunning results. It's no surprise these all came out in the same year - 1999 - right before the turn of the century. The early net art movement was already at work and at the cutting edge of exploring how data can appeal to our most basic senses, experimenting with new ways to view information, breaking free from the established standards of web design which existed even in the early days. Each site affords the user varying levels of controls, with starry night being the most interesting at modeling human behavior, with an artistic rendition of a night sky with constellations representing email threads, even modeling popularity by modifying the brightness of the star as an email archive was accessed more. But what each site reminds us of is that machine is fundamentally different from man, and even when we may be fooled into viewing it through the lense of humanity (as can be seen now with generative AI), the underlying algorithms always hold the potential for unexpected results.</p>

    <h3>StarryNight</h3>
    <p class="artist">Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg, 1999</p>
    <p class="description">What if navigating emails felt like wandering the starts? Each email becomes a star in a black void and as you explore related messages constellations are built based on keywords. The more an email gets accessed, the brighter its star shines, artfully modeling human behavior and community engagement through the metaphor of a night sky. <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/starrynight">View work</a></p>

    <h3>m9ndfukc.0+99</h3>
    <p class="artist">Netochka Nezvanova, 1999</p>
    <p class="description">This piece pulls back the curtain on computational processes, making the usually invisible side of software into something you can see and experience. Created by the group known as Netochka Nezvanova, it's deliberately vague, challenging viewers to engage with the machine's logic on its own terms. <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/m9ndfukc-0-99">View work</a></p>

    <h3>Re-move</h3>
    <p class="artist">Lia, 1999-2003</p>
    <p class="description">Geometry and algorithms collide in this audiovisual generator (though that description alone is reductive). The site offers no instructions, just unlabeled icons that invite experimentation. The user can change parameters to guide the visual flow but never master it, creating a tension of control between man and machine. <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/re-move">View work</a></p>
